A web application used that can help you relax or meditate. There are different musics that can help you create a soothing or maybe working enviornments. The different musics involved are:
1. Wind
2. Rain
3. Thunderstorm
4. Forest
5. Car
6. Water

You can play or pause the music at any time. Even you can play multiple musics at a time.
